          <b>Apoclypse</b>
          <p>The year is roughly 2500, but many have completely lost track of that system of time. For most, it is 207 After the Apocalypse, or AA. The time is not 7:29 at night, but rather 19.29, the date being 20-8-23. The previous time and date systems were adopted at around 42 AA, do to its appeal and simplicity to the remaining public. At the time of its invention, there were about 16 different governments that actually had any influence on the world, and so they all agreed to adopt what would later be known as the Luvian system, after the late L. Uvian. In fact, this book is an account of Leonard Uvian’s life, or at least a chunk of it. Truth be told, the system had absolutely nothing to do with him, yet no one will ever remember the name Antonio Maritimo, the guy who actually came up with the system. Such is life.

The main go-to that modern parents use now for why in God’s name we destroyed our planet, most of us, and everything we built is the Global war of 2103. It was not called World War III because almost every country fought and slaughtered one another, rather than the comparatively small amount that participated in the previous World Wars. Now, back to the actual story, not that we started in the first place.

The prominent and and most common character in this fable of mine was known to many as Leonard V. Uvian. I do not prefer to use terms such as “main,” or “important” to describe him as he is neither. He is of little consequence, the exact opposite of necessary. If he had never existed, nothing would be different. He never had any grand destiny of some sort, he was simply an ordinary fellow trying his best to survive. The point of interest within these miserably boring beginning pages of this book takes place on a cold September morning, in the little metal shack Leo called home. In truth, he had absolutely no right to do so. The 15 acres surrounding and containing his home was technically the legal property of the Government of the Third State Agreement, formerly known as the Government of California, yet no one ever cared or knew what was legally something or legally not. You owned where you lived and what you used. The rest was considered claimable. But even then, most people still didn’t follow any rules. You always had to be cautious of raiders and thieves, many of whom had to be cautious of other raiders and thieves. It’s a dangerous world.

Currently, Leo was sitting on a broken couch, eating a small portion of god-knows-what. Not even he knew. All he knew was that it came from the marketplace down in Shardsen. The actual name was Oaksburg Street. Oaksburg Street received its nickname for the complex and somewhat scattered array of broken glass that had collected over the decades that the area has been inhabited. The actual living quarters of Shardsen was comprised of mostly little tents and huts built out of the rubble, but there were a lucky few that got their hands on a house that wasn’t too damaged to make a good living space. The majority of people, though, agreed to use the remaining houses as public buildings, such as meeting places or market houses. There were a few greedy folks who claimed these building as their own and refused to give it up. Such is life.

Leo, now out of his house, began to wonder what he should bring on his hunting trip. He quietly walked over to the small tarp nailed to the ground behind his hut and knelt down. He took the nails out one by one, and tossed them aside carefully in the dirt next to him. Next, he pulled away the tarp, revealing several rifles and a few rounds of ammo lying in a small wooden box half buried in the ground. Leo took a short bit to decide which was best to bring on the current occasion, and, after making the decision, set off on his daily hunting trip. It was a routine practice for him and his parents when he was young, and he saved quite a bit of hassle trying to trade something for it at the market, as currency was simply a nuisance. So, in lieu of the sudden realization that daylight was fading fast, and as it was quite hazardous to wander off into the night, Leo Uvian set out and about in his way to his preferred hunting ground, a place which he so proudly labeled Leonard Uvian’s Hunting ground. Creative, eh?

After about twelve minutes of walking, Leo came to what should have been a large clearing with two boulders in the middle. Instead, he found himself at the edge of a road, with several telephone poles lining the sides. The road stretched for miles upon miles, without any sign of end. Suddenly, Leo realized that he was wearing a white and blue jumpsuit with a name tag that read Leonard V. Uvian. Fitting.
Behind him, as he soon found out, was a large white building with a large red sign on it that read “Shardsen.” Odd. Now, off in the distance, Leo could hear a vague whooshing noise, and it was getting louder by the second. Soon enough, on the road in front of him was a car. Not your average broken vine-covered car that you find in ruins, but a nice, clean, brand new car. Within that car was a tall man with short, black hair and thin, pale lips that matched his pointy nose. The figure was clad in a beige T-shirt and white pants that dragged on the ground. He got out of the car.
“What’s a fellow like you doin’ so far from town? You oughta be pretty lost. You need a ride?” the fellow said in an obviously Boston accent, or at least to us. To Leo, this was totally new and strange, but at least the person spoke English. Leo nodded, and hopped in the car. He had never been in a working car before, and this one was as clean one could imagine. Something, Leo knew, was off. No one had a working car, and there weren’t any roads left for a car to drive. Suddenly, there was an odd ringing noise coming from the glove compartment. As it was coming from the glove compartment, it was muted and quiet, but the second the man opened it, the noise was blaring right in Leo’s here. He cringed and squirmed, but the noise wouldn’t go away. Suddenly, it stopped, and the man started talking. As Leo looked up, he noticed the man was holding his hand up to his ear. After a few minutes, he took his hand away from his ear. Just then, they pulled into a city. This city was very different from anything Leo had seen. It was tall, filled with buildings and cars, with absolutely no ruins. There were people filing throughout the streets, and everything and one was noisy. As the car stopped, Leo turned toward the man.
“Hey, uh mister, what year is it?” Leo asked.
“What do mean? It’s 2015, everybody knows tha—” Suddenly, the man turned quiet. “You aren’t, by any chance, Leo Uvian?” 
“Why indeed I am, in fact.”
“The insane asylum escapee?”
“What? No, I just got here from Shardsen.”
“The mental hospital?”
“No, the town!”
“Shardsen is a mental hospital, not a town. Maybe one of the patients might think that, though.” the man said accusingly. Just as that heated conversation was about to turn into an argument, sirens began blaring behind them in a furious jumble of police cars, filled with the city’s so-called “finest.”Amongst these cops was a woman in her early forties, Diane Burgan, on her last mission. She had just won the lottery, but didn’t know it yet, as she had just been called for backup on the imposing threat of a mental patient. As she got out of her car, the man pulled out a revolver from behind his back, and fired madly at the gathering police officers. One of the victims of this act of survival and violence was Diane. Such is life.

Leo, who had never seen anything like these people, clad in blue garments and golden badges, was utterly confused. They had to be the rich of this time, what with their fancy clothes and access to such weaponry and cars. The golden badges must be a sign of their wealth. Anyways, this had no effect on Leo’s decision to blow half of their heads off. But, behind him, his ever-faithful driver knocked the gun out of his hand and punched him in the face. Lying on the ground, Leo was forcibly dragged into a black van that read in bold letters Shardsen County Mental Hospital. They threw him in the back, closed and locked it, and hopped eagerly in the front. They had been attempting to catch the Shardsen escapee for the last 3 hours, and were totally sick of it. Around the town, they had been going from door to door, attempting to find out if anyone had seen the man, Leonard. No such luck. Anyways, inch by inch, or so it felt, they drove out of the city, out of the utter and absolute chaos of organization. In they went to the forest, the wilderness. The forest, interestingly enough, had no name, in a world where everything had to be labeled. The forest was partially owned by the city land trust, but the government had bought up just about anything they could get their hands on, and thus ended up with about an acre of grubby forest on which to build one of the most notorious places in the county, the Shardsen County Mental Hospital. It had housed hundreds of people who would later end up being released only to commit dozens of felonies. A good number of patients had escaped over the last few years, and so they buffed up their security, which is why people were so surprised when they had heard that a man had escaped. Now, in lieu of the fact that they had put up Shardsen County Mental Hospital, there was a large need for a road, but the county had already used up most of its reserve on the hospital, so they came to the conclusion to temporarily place a rough dirt road for going to and fro. That 20 was years ago. Now, the dirt road was extremely rough, and almost impossible to get through, and thus, the van hit a log, and flipped over. The front of it was crushed, but a part of it was ripped open, sending one of officers flying out of the car. Had he not been killed in the process, he would have ended up getting shot the very next day. Such is life.

Leo woke up sprawled on the ground, with a faint smell of smoke in the air. He looked around him briefly, and found that he was back in his hunting grounds, with no sign of the van. He was back in his old clothes, and saw his gun off in the distance. Almost immediately, the faint smell of smoke had vanished, and Leo might as well have never even seen the van. He got up, and dusted himself off, looking around for any sign of the crash. No such luck. What he noticed later though, was a small badge worn by the people who took him away, that read Annebrook City Police Force. He ignored this, and ran off into the forest.
